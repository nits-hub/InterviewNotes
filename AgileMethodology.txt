1. Agile methodology is a flelxible and iterative approach used for software development and project management.

2. Its main focus is on fast delivery, continuous improvement and customer satisfaction.

3. It breaks down the big problem into smaller iterations (sprints) and works on them step by step.

    Main Principles of Agile methodology:
    1. Customer Collaboration - Regular feedback is taken from customers to ensure the product meets their needs.

    2. Iterative Development – The project is divided into small phases (sprints), where each sprint delivers a working feature.

    3. Flexibility – Requirements can change, and the team can adapt accordingly.

    4. Continuous Improvement – After every sprint, the team reviews what worked well and what needs improvement.

    5. Cross-functional Teams – Developers, testers, and designers work together as a self-organized team.
