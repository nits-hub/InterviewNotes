1. Django - 
    -> Django is a high-level, open-source Python web framework that enables the rapid development of web applications.
    -> It follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture.
    -> Django emphasizes reusability, modularity, security, and scalability.

    key features:
        -> Secure - Comes with built-in protection against common web vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF.
        -> Rich Ecosystem: Provides ready-to-use components like authentication, URL routing, ORM, and admin panel.
        -> Scalable: Easily handles heavy traffic and large-scale projects.

2. Virtual Environment - 
    -> A virtual environment is an isolated environment for Python projects. 
    -> It ensures that dependencies for one project do not interfere with others, allowing you to maintain different versions of Python packages for different projects.
