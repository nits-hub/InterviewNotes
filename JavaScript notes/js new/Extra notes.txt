// Garbage Collection
// In languages like C, C++, one have to manually allocate(assign) the memory, and deallocate(free) the memory for unused variables/objects.
// but JS automatically allocates memory when objects are created and frees it when they are not used anymore (garbage collection).
// and we have no control over G.C. like when to start and when to stop
// It runs as the background process in JS engine.
