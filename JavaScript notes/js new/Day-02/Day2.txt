Day - 2 -> Control Flow and Conditionals

Conditional statements
    Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. 
    The most common conditional statements in JavaScript are:

        1. if statements - The if statement executes a block of code if a specified condition evaluates to true.
        2. if-else statements - else part will execute if the if condition evaluates to false.
        3. if else-if else statements - You can use else if to check for multiple conditions. If none of the if or else if conditions evaluate to true, the else block is executed.
        4. switch-case-default - 

Loops 
    Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly, based on a condition.

    Types of loops - 
        1. for loop - executes a block of code specified number of times.
        2. while loop - executes a block of code while the specified condition is not satisfied.
        3. do while loop - similar to while loop, but the block of code is executed once until the condition is tested.
        4. for...in loop - is used to Iterates over the properties of an object.
        5. for...of loop - is used to iterate over iterable objects such as arrays, strings, and sets.


        e.g., for...in loop

            syntax: 
                for (let key in object) {
                    // Code to execute for each property
                }

            code:
                const person = {name: 'Alice', age: 25, city: 'New York'};

                for (let key in person) {
                    console.log(key + ": " + person[key]);
                }
                // Outputs: 
                // name: Alice
                // age: 25
                // city: New York
        

        e.g., for...of loop

            syntax: 
                for (let element of iterable) {
                    // Code to execute for each element
                }

            code:
                const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];
                for (let fruit of fruits) {
                    console.log(fruit);
                }
                // Outputs: apple banana cherry
