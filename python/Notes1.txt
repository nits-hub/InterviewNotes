Python - 
    Python is a popular programming language. It was developed by Guido Van Rossum, and released in 1991.
    It is used for:
        1. Web Development (server-side)
        2. Software Development
        3. Mathematics
        4. System scripting.

*Indentation - refers to the space at the beginning of a code line.
    -> Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
    -> Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation.

    Note - * The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, the most common use is four, but it has to be at least one.

# Variable
{
    Variables - container for storing data values.
    -> python is a dynamically typed PL.
    -> That's why it has no commands for declaring variables.
    -> Variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

    Note - * Variable names are case-sensitive
    e.g., 
        x = 5
        y = 10
        print(x, y)     //5,10

    e.g., 
        x = 5
        x = "hello"
        print(x)        //hello

    Casting - If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.
    e.g.,
        x = int("10")
        y = str(3)
        z = float(3)

    Get the type - to get the type of variable use the type() function.
    e.g, 
        x = 5
        y = "hell"
        print(type(x))
        print(type(y))

    Many Values to Multiple Variables - assign values to multiple variables in one line.
    e.g.,
        x, y, z = "one", "two", "three"
        print(x)
        print(y)
        print(z)

    One value to multiple variable
    e.g.,
        x = y = z = "Orange"
        print(x,y,z)

    unpack a collection - 
        -> If you have a collection of values in list, tuple etc. Python allows you to extract the values into variables.
        -> This is called unpacking.
    e.g., 
        fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
        a,b,c = fruits 
        print(x,y,z)

    Global Variable - 
        -> variables created outside of a function are known as global variable, and can be accessible by both inside of a function and outside.
        e.g.,
            x = "awesome"

            def myfunc():
                print("Python is "+ x)
            
            myfunc()

        
        * The global keyword - To create a global variable inside a function, you can use the global keyword.
        e.g.,
            def myfunc():
                global x = "awesome"
            
            myfunc()

            print("Python is "+ x)
}

# Data type  
{
    Data types - Python has rich set of data types, and they are classified into 8 categories:

        1. Text Type        - str 
        2. Numeric Types    - int, float, complex
        3. Sequence Types   - list, tuple, range
        4. Mapping types    - dict 
        5. Set Types        - set, frozenset
        6. Boolean Types    - bool
        7. Binary Types     - bytes, bytearray, memoryview
        8. None Type        - NoneType

    type constructors - If you want to specify the data type, you can use the following constructor functions:
    x = str("Hello World")
        int()
        float()
        complex()
        list()
        tuple()
        range()
        dict()
        set()
        frozenset()
        bool()
        bytes()
        bytearray()
        memoryview(bytes(5))
    
        Note - * Constructor functions can also be used for type conversions.
