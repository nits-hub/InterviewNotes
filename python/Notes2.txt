# All about strings
{
    String - In python, string is sequence of characters that is represented by either single quote or double quote.

    Multiline string declaration - 
    e.g.,
        a = """Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
               consectetur adipiscing elit,
               sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt."""

        print(a)

    Looping through string - 
    e.g., 
        for x in "banana":
            print(x)
    
    string library functions - 
        1. len() - 
            e.g., 
                a = "Hello, World!"
                print(len(a))

        2. in - to check if a certain phrase or character is present in a sting.

            e.g., 
                a = "Hello, World!"
                print("World" in a)

                or 

                if "World" in a: 
                    print("Yes, 'free' is present.")


        3. not in - 
            e.g., 


        4. slicing - to return a range of characters or substring.
            e.g., 
                b = "Hello, World!"
                print(b[2:5])

            a. Slice From the Start - 
                By leaving out the start index, the range will start at the first character:


            b. Slice To the End
                By leaving out the end index, the range will go to the end:

            c. Negative indexing
                Use negative indexes to start the slice from the end of the string:
                e.g., 
                    b = "Hello, World!"
                    print(b[-5:-2]) //orl
        5. upper() - to convert the string in uppercase
        6. lower() - to convert the sting in lowercase
        7. strip() - works same as trim method
        8. replace("actual string", "desired string")
        9. split() - The split() method returns a list where the text between the specified separator becomes the list items.
        10. Format sting - 

            -> This is invalid syntax in python to format string
                e.g.,   
                    age = 36
                    txt = "My name is John, I am " + age
                    print(txt)
            -> The correct way
