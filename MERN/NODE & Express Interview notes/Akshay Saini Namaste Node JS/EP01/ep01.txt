1. Quick and Easiest way to write code in Node.js is using:
-> Node REPL(Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop)

2. type command "node" to enter the Node REPL:
-> node
-> 1+2
3
-> console.log("hello")
hello
undefined

i.e., It reads the code, 
      Evaluate the code, 
      print the output, 
      and then loop.

Note: 
    1. Node.js is a chrome's [V8 JS-Engine + SuperPowers]
    2. SuperPower is nothing but the global object that has all the properties which powers up the Node.js., and we can access by running the command global.
        a. global 
    3. In the browser Window is the global object and we can access it by running the command:
        a. this
        b. window 
        c. self
        d. frames
    4. There is a common global object - "globalThis", around all the browsers and runtime environment that supports javascript.
