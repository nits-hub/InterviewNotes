LifeCycle Methods - 
    1. Mounting Phase (When component is created).
        a. In this phase, the component is created and inserted into the dom. It consists of:
            1. constructor() - Initializes state and binds methods.
            2. static getDerivedStateFromProps() - Syncs state with props before rendering.
            3. render() - Renders the UI.
            4. componentDidMount() - Runs after component mounts. Used for API calls, event listeners, etc.

            e.g.,
                import React, {Component} from "react";

                class MountingExample extends Component {
                    constructor(props){
                        super(props);
                        this.state = {count: 0}
                        console.log("Constructor: Component is being initialized")
                    }

                    static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) {
                        console.log("getDerivedStateFromProps: Syncing state with props", props)
                        return null;
                    }

                    componentDidMount() {
                        console.log("componentDidMount: Component mounted to the DOM")
                    }

                    render() {
                        console.log("Render: Rendering component");
                        return <h2>Component Mounted</h2>
                    }
                }

                export default MountingExample

    2. Updating Phase (When Component Renders Again)
        a. In this phase, component re-renders due to changes in state or props. It consists of: 
            1. getDerivedStateFromProps() - Syncs state with props before rendering.
            2. shouldComponentUpdate() - Controls if the component should re-render.
            3. render() -  Re-renders the component when state/props change.
            4. getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() - Captures the DOM state before the update.
            5. componentDidUpdate - Runs after the component updates. Used for API calls, DOM updates, side effects.

    3. Unmounting Phase (When Component is Removed)
        a. In this phase, the component is removed from the dom. It consist of:
            1. componentWillUnmount - Runs before unmounting. Used to clean up timers, event listeners, or API calls.
